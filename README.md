## Quick start

### Caution

This software runs only with **Python3** and **Tkinter** installed
on your machine.

**No dependencies**, no third-part lib to install on more.

If you have Python3 correctly installed, Tkinter library should also
be installed **by default** as a Python standard lib.

Any **ImportError** will mean either you are trying to launch the
game with Python2 or you don't have **Tkinter** library correctly
installed on your system.

Installing a Python3 version of the language **does not alter** an
already installed Python2 version in any way.

You may consider installing Python3 from:

https://www.python.org/downloads/ (Ctrl+click: open in new tab)

### Additional resources

To get a better look'n'feel, one may install typefont family files
located in
